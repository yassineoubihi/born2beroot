2. Then open up a iTerm2 seperate from your Virtual Machine and type in iTerm `ssh your_host_name42@127.0.0.1 -p 4242` and then type your password, when it asks for it. 
3. Then type `cd /usr/local/bin`.
4. Then type `nano monitoring.sh` and paste the text above into the vim monitoring.sh you just created, by doing `command` + `v` on your Apple keyboard.
5. Save and Exit your `monitoring.sh`
- 5.1 - Then type `exit` to exit the iTerm SSH Login.
- 5.2 - Then go back to your Virtual Machine (not iTerm) and continue on with the steps below. 
6. Then type `sudo visudo` to open your sudoers file 
7. Add in this line `your_username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/monitoring.sh` under where its written %sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
8. It should look like this
![1*l-7LtAqCon1gRkV3dY3qiQ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58959408/174727595-11dbb2f9-9c34-4d11-870b-f832ea4a9224.png)

10. Now type `sudo reboot` in your Virtual Machine to reboot sudo
11. Type `sudo /usr/local/bin/monitoring.sh` to execute your script as su (super user)
12. Type `sudo crontab -u root -e` to open the crontab and add the rule
13. Lastly at the end of the crontab, type the following `*/10 * * * * /usr/local/bin/monitoring.sh` this means that every 10 mins, this script will show


## Part 4 - Signature.txt (Last Part Before Defence)

⚠️ Warning: before you generate a signature number, turn off your Virtual Machine. ⚠️

1. Open iTerm and type `cd`
1. Then type `cd sgoinfre/students/<your_intra_username>/VirtualBox VMs`
2. Type `shasum VirtualBox.vdi` or whatever your Virtual Machine is called (This can take from a few seconds to 5 mins).
3. Copy the output number and create a signature.txt file and paste that number in the file. 
3. Now you submit the signature.txt file with the output number in it.

## Part 5 - Born2BeRoot Defence Evaluation with Answers

[Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-BwCO0udUP7MhRh81Y681zz0BalXtKFtte_FHJc6G4s/edit) to the [Born2BeRoot Evaluation Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-BwCO0udUP7MhRh81Y681zz0BalXtKFtte_FHJc6G4s/edit) created by [Adrian Musso-Gonzalez](https://github.com/AdrianMussoGonzalez).

### The Evaluation Questions

### Why did I choose Debian?
Easier to install and configure so better for personal servers.

### Difference between Debian and CentOS?
Debian is a lot easier to update then CentOS when a new version is released. Debian is more user-friendly and supports many libraries, filesystems and architecture. It also has more options for customisation. If you are a larger business CentOS offers more Enterprise features and excellent support for the Enterprise software. 

![1*EUhkzOMoiT_KEF3j402O6g](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58959408/175495740-d4599f59-25b1-43ba-9c01-ba4246096f8a.png)

### What is a Virtual Machine?
Is a resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs or apps. Each VM has its own operating system and functions separately, so you can have more than one VM per machine. Can be used to test applications in a safe, separate environment. Works by using software to simulate virtual hardware and run on a host machine.

### What is the difference between aptitude and APT (Advanced Packaging Tool)?
* Aptitude is a high-level package manager while APT is lower level which can be used by other higher level package managers
* Aptitude is smarter and will automatically remove unused packages or suggest installation of dependent packages
* Apt will only do explicitly what it is told to do in the command line

### What is AppArmor?
Linux security system that provides Mandatory Access Control (MAC) security. Allows the system admin to restrict the actions that processes can perform. It is included by default with Debian. Run aa-status to check if it is running.

### Password Rules
For the password rules, we use the password quality checking library and there are two files the common-password file which sets the rules like upper and lower case characters, duplicate characters etc and the login.defs file which stores the password expiration rules (30 days etc).
Sudo nano /etc/login.defs
Sudo nano /etc/pam.d/common-password

### What is LVM
Logical Volume Manager – allows us to easily manipulate the partitions or logical volume on a storage device. 

### UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) 
UFW is a interface to modify the firewall of the device without compromising security. You use it to configure which ports to allow connections to and which ports to close. This is useful in conjunction with SSH, can set a specific port for it to work with.

### What is SSH?
SSH or Secure Shell is an authentication mechanism between a client and a host. It uses encryption techniques so that all communication between clients and hosts is done in encrypted form. User on Mac or Linux can use SSH the terminal to work on their server via SSH.

### What is Cron?
Cron or cron job is a command line utility to schedule commands or scripts to happen at specific intervals or a specific time each day. Useful if you want to set your server to restart at a specific time each day. 

- `cd /usr/local/bin` – to show monitoring.sh
- `sudo crontab -u root -e` – to edit the cron job
- `change script to */1 * * * * sleep 30s && script path` – to run it every 30 seconds, delete the line to stop the job from running.

### Evaluation Commands for UFW, Group, Host, lsblk and SSH

- `sudo ufw status`
- `sudo systemctl status ssh`
- `getent group sudo`
- `getent group user42`
- `sudo adduser new username`
- `sudo groupadd groupname`
- `sudo usermod -aG groupname username`
- `sudo chage -l username` - check password expire rules
- `hostnamectl`
- `hostnamectl set-hostname new_hostname` - to change the current hostname
- Restart your Virtual Machine.
- `sudo nano /etc/hosts` - change current hostname to new hostname
- `lsblk` to display the partitions
- `dpkg -l | grep sudo –` to show that sudo is installed
- `sudo ufw status numbered`
- `sudo ufw allow port-id`
- `sudo ufw delete rule number`
- `ssh your_user_id@127.0.0.1 -p 4242` -  do this in terminal to show that SSH to port 4242 is working
